# LENDING_CLUB_PROJECT
Project Overview
Dataset: LendingClub loan data (CSV format)
Size: 1.7 GB
Records: 2+ million
Columns: 118
Tools Used: PySpark, HDFS
The project required breaking down the raw dataset into multiple logical components to enable modular processing and analysis.

🧹 Data Engineering Workflow
🔹 Step 1: Dataset Segmentation
We extracted and curated 4 primary datasets from the raw file:

Dataset Name	Description
customers_data	Borrower details including income, employment, and credit grade
loans_data	Loan-level information such as amount, term, interest rate, and status
loan_repayments	Repayment history including principal, interest, and late fees
loan_defaulters	Delinquency and bankruptcy indicators for risk profiling
Additional derived datasets:

loan_defaulters_delinq_csv
loan_defaulters_records_inq_csv
These were written to the cleaned folder after preprocessing.

🔹 Step 2: Data Quality Handling
Identified and isolated corrupt or malformed records
Moved all bad data to:
📁 /user/itv021558/lendingclubproject/bad Note: This data is excluded from processing and will be handled by the upstream data team.
🔹 Step 3: Table Creation
Created permanent Hive-compatible tables on top of the cleaned datasets to enable SQL-based querying and analytics.

🔹 Step 4: Loan Score Calculation
Engineered a new metric: Loan Score, based on repayment behavior and risk indicators.

Output stored at:
📁 /user/itv021558/lendingclubproject/processed/loan_score
